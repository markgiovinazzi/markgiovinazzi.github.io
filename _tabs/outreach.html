            As a first-generation college student, one of the primary gaps in academia that I am actively working to bridge is the one that exists between undergrad and grad. To address this, I created a program called Penn GRAD (Graduate Readiness and Application Development) that helps to address systemic barriers within physics and academia. Penn GRAD’s mission is to increase the accessibility of graduate physics programs, particularly for marginalized groups and first-generation college students who lack the resources necessary to successfully apply. This program has helped more than 100 college students apply for graduate school, primarily from the Philadelphia area but also internationally via virtual communication. The program fosters one-on-one mentoring, pairing each undergraduate with a Penn graduate student whose research aligns with their student’s.<br /><br />

           I have Tourette Syndrome (TS), a neurological disorder characterized by vocal and motor tics. In my personal life, I have had the chance to interact with some outstanding members of the TS community who have thrived. In physics, however, I have seldom known anybody else to have Tourette Syndrome. Whether due to a barrier to entry for students with TS or a lack of advocacy within academia, my aim is to serve as a role model for others, and I am committed to demonstrating that students with Tourette Syndrome can reach for the stars. I am featured on “Tourette’s Podcast” (S7 E9: “Exoplanets”), and have created a virtual support group for adults with TS that meets regularly.
